-=- Pattomobile To Do List -=-

These are the ideas I have for Pattomobile, of course any suggestions are welcome and will be considered.

√. Port physics to APE v0.45a
	¤ currently is v0.2
	√ more organisation of particles
	√ create 'cleanup' methods for each object
	√ sort objects into groups:
		√ fixed: don't move at all, can't collide with each other (RectangleSurface, Switch, Exit, etc.)
		√ mobile: can move freely and collide with each other aswell as fixed and other (Car, LaserPatto, BGM, etc.)
		¤ other: have special needs, like only colliding with particular objects (Bridge, Squish, etc.)
√. Create various new physics objects
	√ 'squishy' surfaces: a polygon of spring constraints with extra tension
	¤ realistic bridge: some sort of strengthening?
	√ better bouncy blocks, not so violent
	√ Half-pipe (concave curve) for Skate Park
√. Finish making all bonus levels
	√ 1: Jungle Hi-jinx
	√ 2: Jumping Castle
	√ 3: Skate Park
	√ 4: This is just getting ridiculous!
	√ 5: Anti-gravity Chamber
	√ 6: Mmmm... Squishy stuff!
	√ 7: It's raining Patto
	√ 8: Catch a Ride
	√ 9: When the laws of physics go out the window
√. Make 2 bonus skins
	√ 8: Flame
	√ 9: Invisible
√. Make bonus cutscene
	√ reward for unlocking everything else
	√ spazo patto
√. Maybe some better graphics?
	√ glowy fields for bouncers and hoverpads etc.
	¤ more detail in backgrounds, rather than just plain colours
	¤ the efficiency of APE v0.45a should allow for more vector graphics
¤. Audio!
	¤ Collect good music for levels
	¤ Record sound effects from Alex
	¤ Create some sort of sound system
	
As of Pattomobile v1.3 r5, the game is finished.
